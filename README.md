# Formula1 Data Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze race and weather data from 2018 to 2022 using machine learning models to predict race position categories ("Other," "Top 10," "Top 3") for drivers for all races in 2023.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas requests fastf1

## Scripts Overview

**get_season_schedule.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas, requests  

- This program uses the Ergast API to fetch the season schedule for the races in the year 2018 to 2023.

- The output for this program will be stored in season_schedule directory.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 get_season_schedule.py
  ```
**pit_stop.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas,os,requests

- This program uses the Ergast API to fetch the average pit stop times along with its standard deviation for each race and driver.

- The output for this program will be stored as file already included in the code.

- **Note:** Please run the get_season_schedule.py before this as it uses the output files generated by it.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 pit_stop.py
  ```

**get_quali_results.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas,requests

- This program uses the Ergast API to fetch the data for qualification races held before the actual races for years 2018 to 2023.

- The output for this program will be stored in quali_data directory.

- **Note:** Please run the get_season_schedule.py before this as it uses the output files generated by it.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 get_quali_results.py
  ```

**get_driver_data.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas,requests

- This program uses the Ergast API to fetch the data for all the drivers in the year 2018 to 2023.

- The output for this program will be stored in driver_data directory.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 get_driver_data.py
    ```
**get_points_and_wins.py**
- **Required Libraries:** pandas,requests

- This program uses the Ergast API to fetch the total wins before 2017 and season wins along with season points for year 2018 to 2023 for all drivers.

- The output for this program will be stored in driver_data directory.

- **Note:** Please run the get_driver_data.py before this as it uses the output files generated by it.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 get_points_and_wins.py
    ```
**race_data.py**
- **Required Libraries:** pandas,requests

- This program uses the Ergast API to fetch the data for all races between the years 2018 to 2023.

- The output for this program will be stored in race_data directory.

- **Note:** Please run the get_points_and_wins.py before this as it uses the output files generated by it.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 race_data.py
    ```
**calculate_driver_error.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas,requests

- This program calculates the metric Probability of Error for each driver.

- The output for this program will be stored in race_error directory.

- **Note:** Please run the race_data.py before this as it uses the output files generated by it.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 calculate_driver_error.py
    ```
**weather_data.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas,fastf1

- This program uses fastf1, a python package to get the average weather data for the day of the race.

- The output for this program will be stored in weather_data directory.

- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 weather_data.py
    ```

**calculate_constructor_error_py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas,os
- This program calculates the metric Constructor Confidence which is an importanat feature in our analysis.
- The output for this program will be stored in race_error directory.
- **Note:** Please run the race_data.py and pit_stop.py before this as it uses the output files generated by it.
- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 calculate_constructor_error_py
    ```

**merge_data.py**
- **Required Libraries:** pandas
- This program merges all the data in one dataset to preprocess.
- The output for this program will be stored in merged_data directory.
- **Note:** Please run all the files mentioned before this to get output.
- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 merge_data.py
    ```
**preprocessing_data.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas, sklearn.preprocessing
- This program preprocesses the merged dataset.
- The output for this program will be stored in merged_data directory.
- **Note:** Please run the merge_data.py before this.
- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 preprocessing_data.py
    ```

**ML_New_Classification.py**

- **Required Libraries:** pandas, sklearn.ensemble,sklearn.metrics, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.svm, sklearn.tree
- BEFORE YOU RUN: create a directory called ML_Outputs
- This program is the main code that trains a voting classifier on preprocessed merged dataset and checks its accuracy on the dataset for 2023.
- **Note:** Please run the all the files before this to get the output.
- This can be run with:
- ``` bash
  python3 ML_New_Classification.py
    ```
